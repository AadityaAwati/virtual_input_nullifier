# Virtual Input Nullifier

This python program is quite a simple one, and utilizes with the various properties of a tkinter window to create a full-screen, transparent window. The "fullscreen" property even hides the entire title bar of the window!
When made transparent, it appears as if no window is open, and the un-aware user will attempt to click and type with absolutely no result. The effect works even more better, when you keep an application like Chrome open and then run the program.
The program even renders the task-bar useless.

The only way to break free from the window is to use  Windows + D (Shortcut to minimize all windows), Alt + Tab (Shortcut to switch to another window), or by using the Windows Button.
